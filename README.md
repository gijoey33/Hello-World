# Hello-World
Ave Maria Gratia Plena, the Original Hello World Greeting that revealed the Original Plan of LOVE. MamD
From all eternity, Oh God, Thou hast called me out of Thy LOVE into a human being:
Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you,Â a prophet to the nations I appointed you. Jeremiah 1:5
